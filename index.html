                <h2>Empowered women</h2>
                <p><b>Savitribai Phule</b> was an early female teacher in India, Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. Along with her husband, Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played a vital role in improving women's rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and Jyotiba together founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhidewada in 1848. She strived to abolish discrimination and unfair treatment of people on the basis of caste and gender.
                She and her husband were pioneers of women's education in India. They started their first school for girls in 1848 in Pune at Tatyasaheb Bhide's residence or Bhidewada.
                Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 at the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra. Her birthplace is about fifteen km  from Shirval and about 50 km from Pune. Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and Khandoji Nevase Patil, both of whom belonged to the Mali Community. She had three siblings. Savitribai married her husband Jyotirao Phule at the age of 9 or 10 . Though they had no children of their own. It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However, there is no original evidence available yet to support this. It is said that Yashwant was unable to get married because he was born to a widow, and community beliefs disallowed marriage of "such people". Hence Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February of 1889.
